          <h2>Babasaheb Ambedkar</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>, also known as Baba Saheb Ambedkar, was born on April 14,
             1891, at Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, India. He was a good student earning doctorates from 
             both London University and Columbia University of London. He gained a reputation as a
              scholar for his research in law, economics, and political science. in his early carrier,
               he was an editor, economist, professor, and activist who was against the discrimination
                Dalits faced because of caste. Dr. B.R.Ambedkar's later career included participating
                 in political activities.

                 Dr B R Ambedkar was born in a caste which was considered as the lowest of the 
                 low. But this very man framed the Constitution for the country. His life was 
                 one of struggles, as his radical proposals to deal with the Caste System met 
                 with overt hostility from the Upper Castes. Not only did the great Doctor fight
                 against all institutional and social odds to keep studying, but spectacularly
                 earned a Doctorate in Economics from Columbia University in 1917.

                  The boy who suffered bitter caste humiliation became the first Minister for Law
                  in free India, and shaped the country’s Constitution. Dr. Ambedkar's struggle
                  against Brahmanical Patriarchy, his radical proposals for the Hindu Code Bill,
                  and his suggestions for a radical restructuring of property relations,
                  alert us to his challenging of the status-quo. Dr. Ambedkar, perhaps India’s
                  most radical thinker, transformed the social and political landscape in the struggle against British Colonialism,
                   by making the downtrodden politically aware of their own situation. Ambedkar famously said to Dalits something
                    that bears immense importance even today – “Educate, Agitate, and Organise”.. .
              Clearly, he laid a great emphasis on education, specially where it was tradionally denied.
              In fact, he is known to have said once that education was more important than Temple entry 
              for the downtrodden.He saw Education as a potent tool which could equally empower every 
              citizen to build an egalitarian society as also to help break the age-old restrictive shackles
               of discriminatory social practices. As a college bearing his name we continually strive to
                to emulate his vision and help empower the future generation build a holistic, inclusive and
                 progressive society of Modern India.
